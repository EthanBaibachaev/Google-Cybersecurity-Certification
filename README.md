Certificate for Ethan Baibachaev, Google Cybersecurity, offered through Coursera. 

Those who earn the Google Cybersecurity Certificate have completed eight courses, developed by Google, that include hands-on, practice-based assessments and are designed to prepare them for entry-level roles in cybersecurity. 

They are competent in beginner-level Python, Linux, SQL, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). They know how to identify common cybersecurity risks, threats, and vulnerabilities, as well as the techniques to mitigate.

This course covered topics such as:

<li>Risk management</li>
<li>Threat analysis</li>
<li>Network security</li>
<li>Incident response</li>

<br>

It taught me new technical skills in:

<li>Network protocol analyzers (Wireshark and tcpdump)</li>
<li>SIEM Tools (Chronicle and Splunk)</li>
<li>IDS/IPS Tools</li>
<li>Firewalls</li>

<br>

I was able to brush up on a lot of fundamental information and develop even further in the following skills:

<li>Python</li>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>Linux</li>
